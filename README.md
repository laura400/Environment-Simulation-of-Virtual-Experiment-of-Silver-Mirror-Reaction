# Environment-Simulation-of-Virtual-Experiment-of-Silver-Mirror-Reaction
Our Environment Simulation of Virtual Experiment of Silver Mirror Reaction is based on Experiment of Silver Mirror Reaction, aiming at providing users with an interesting and vivid simulation tutoring experience.  
In this Virtual Experimental Environment, we provide players with a set of breakers with solution name it contain as tag under the breakers, a tube holder, a test tube and a pipette to operate and a menu borad for the player to check the progress of reaction steps, a formula board to check the chemical formula.In this lab, players can freely control the amount of reactants to get a different result phenomenon at each step of reactions.

## Establish goals
#### UI Design
1. Basic chemical lab instruments for the player to operate
2. Variable guide Lab menu
3. Seeable kind and the concentration of reactants  

#### Chemical Reaction Process Simulation
1. Correct recorded reactant amount and calculated products amount
2. Depoist Creation and Dissolution according to the amount of deposit.
3. Lifelike changable deposit creation and dissolution

#### Reaction Phenonmenon Presentation
1. Visual increase of liquid height when liquid dropping-in
2. Presentation of Particle System to simulate the deposit
3. Lifelike controllable silver mirror phenomenon
